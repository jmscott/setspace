Synopsis:
	Build xml schema using well known GNOME libxml2 library.
Note:
	Certain documents will pass xmllint (and xmlwf) tests for
	"well formness" but also still not be castable into the PostgreSQL 9.5
	xml datatype.  See the blob wtf-45a9c52bf1.xml for an example.  The
	error is probably due to the "xmloption" global configuation option.
