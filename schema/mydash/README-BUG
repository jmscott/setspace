The "remember" button fails on the following link. why?

	https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/c39

the issue appears to be the "title" query arg not matching the regular exp
/^.{0,255}$/, e.g.)

cat BUG.txt | perl <<END 
	while (<>) {
		if (m/^.{0,255}$/) {
			print "yes\n";
		} else {
			print "no\n";
		}
	}
END

the failing char is in the phrase "what went wrong", between the "o and "n" chars.  "yes" when snipping all chars after the "o" and "no" where snipping all chars after the "n".  i have no idea why.  see file BUG.txt.  the number of utf8 chars is 103 and the byte count is 334.  perhaps the regex is only counting bytes,
