#  Synopsis:
#	Configuration file read by make-dist to build tar files.
#  See:
#	https://github.com/jmscott/work/blob/master/make-dist
#  Note:
#	Makefile variables can be extracted and defined from the the
#	root.dist file with these recipes.  Example make code follows:
#
#		DIST=product.dist
#
#		COMPILEs := $(shell  (. ./$(DIST) && echo $$COMPILEs))
#		SBINs := $(shell  (. ./$(DIST) && echo $$SBINs))
#		LIBs := $(shell  (. ./$(DIST) && echo $$LIBs))
#		SRCs := $(shell  (. ./$(DIST) && echo $$SRCs))
#		BINs := $(shell  (. ./$(DIST) && echo $$BINs))
#		HTDOCSs := $(shell  (. ./$(DIST) && echo $$HTDOCSs))
#		CGIBINs := $(shell  (. ./$(DIST) && echo $$CGIBINs))
#		LIBEXEC := $(shell  (. ./$(DIST) && echo $$LIBEXECs))
#

#  Uncomment to override default mappings of VARs to target directory
VAR2dir_local=(
	[CGIBINs]='cgi-bin/schema'
	[HTDOCSs]='htdocs/schema/setcore'
	[LIBs]='lib/schema/setcore.d'
)

#  Uncomment for compiled programs to be installed in bin/ or sbin/ and
#  removed in "clean" recipes.
