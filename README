Synopsis:
	SetSpace extracts facts about immutable blobs and puts them in PostgreSQL
Meme:
	SetSpace - Harness the Flux

	Schemas are an impediment to moving fast the same way street lights are.
	Useless if you are alone, critical when there are a 100's of you.

To Do:
	--  Requiring PostgreSQL logical replication implies we may not be
	    able to populate other databases.

	--  think about a custom base32 encoding, taking ideas from these
	    sources:

	      http://philzimmermann.com/docs/human-oriented-base-32-encoding.txt
	      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm

	      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verhoeff_algorithm
	      http://base91.sourceforge.net/

	--  think about a custom hash algorithm, like 192 bit shake256.

	--  Makefile template for new setspace schema

	--  sengine.shtml: link to worldcat.org, icerocket.com

	--  think about pushing from backup database -> live and make live
	    readonly!!!
