Synopsis:
	Route blobs into other schemas based upon patterns in the byte prefix.
Description:
	Blob may be routed to other schemas based upon values in the the
	first 32 bytes of of the blob.  See the table setspace.byte_prefix_32.
	Recipes may also assume that the core byte oriented setspace tables
	have already been populated:

		setspace.{byte_bitmap, byte_count, is_utf8}

	Since most routing rules are immutable, the queries are highly
	cacheable.  cool.
