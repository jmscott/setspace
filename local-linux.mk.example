#  	cd ~/dev/setspace/trunk
#  	cp local-linux.mk.example local.mk
#  	... edit local.mk
#  	make all

#  during development change INSTALL_PREFIX to dir in $HOME, like $(HOME)/opt

#  Some of us don't put go in our PATH.

#  location of pdfbox jar file, version 2
#
#  Note: be carefull installing underneath $(INSTALL_PREFIX),
#        since a 'make distclean' will remove the jar file.
