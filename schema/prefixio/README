Synopsis:
	Route blobs to schemas based upon patterns in the 32 byte prefix.
Description:
	Blob may be routed to other schemas based upon values in the the
	first 32 bytes of of the blob.  See the table setcore.byte_prefix_32.
	Recipes may also assume that the core byte oriented setcore tables
	have already been populated:

		setcore.{byte_bitmap, byte_count, is_utf8}

	Since most routing rules are immutable, the queries are highly
	cacheable.  cool.
Note:
	Consider adding mapping of prefixes/file type to file guesses.
