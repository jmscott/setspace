The "remember" button fails on the following link. why?

	https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/c39

the issue appears to be the "title" query arg not matching the regular exp
/^.{0,255}$/, e.g.)

cat BUG.txt | perl <<END 
	while (<>) {
		if (m/^.{0,255}$/) {
			print "yes\n";
		} else {
			print "no\n";
		}
	}
END

the failing char is in the phrase "what went wrong", between the "o and "n" chars.  "yes" when snipping all chars after the "o" and "no" where snipping all chars after the "n".  the clipped "yes" version is 254 bytes, so i suspect the regex counts bytes.  consider adding "use utf8" in cgi script and  see file BUG.txt.
